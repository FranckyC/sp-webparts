-------|----
<p align="center"><img src="./images/property_pane.png"/><p> | <p align="center"><img src="./images/property_pane2.png"/></p>

Setting | Description 
-------|----
Search query keywords | The search query in KQL format. You can use search query variables (See this [post](http://www.techmikael.com/2015/07/sharepoint-rest-do-support-query.html) to know which ones are allowed).
Query template | The search query template in KQL format. You can use search variables here (like Path:{Site}).
Result Source Identifier | The GUID of a SharePoint result source. If you specify a value here, query template and query keywords won't be applied. Otherwise the default SharePoint result source is used.
Enable Query Rules | Enable the query rules if applies
Selected properties | The search managed properties to retrieve. You can use these properties then in the code like this (`item.property_name`). (See the *Tile.tsx* file) .
Refiners | The search managed properties to use as refiners. Make sure these are refinable. With SharePoint Online, you have to reuse the default ones to do so (RefinableStringXX etc.). The order is the same as they will appear in the refnement panel. You can also provide your own custom labels using the following format RefinableString01:"You custom filter label",RefinableString02:"You custom filter label",...
Number of items to retrieve per page | Quite explicit. The paging behavior is done directly by the search API (See the *SearchDataProvider.ts* file), not by the code on post-render.
Show blank if no result | Shows nothing if there is no result
Show result count | Shows the result count and entered keywords  
Show paging | Indicates whether or not the component should show the paging control at the bottom.
Show file icons | Shows the file icon for individual result 
Show created date | Shows the created date for individual result 


### Taxonomy values dynamic translation

This Web Part supports the translation for taxonomy based filters according to current site language. To get it work, you must map a new refinable managed property associated with *ows_taxId_<your_column_name>* crawled property.

## Features
This Web Part illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

- Build an user friendly search experience on the top of the SharePoint search REST API with paging, refiners and query suggestions using the *@pnp* JavaScript library.
- Integrate the [@pnp/spfx-property-controls](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-property-controls) in your solution (*PlaceHolder* control).
- Integrate multiple Office UI Fabric components (DocumentCard, Panel, GroupedList, ...) to fit with the native Office 365 theme.
- Use the React container component approach inspiring by the [react-todo-basic sample](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-todo-basic).

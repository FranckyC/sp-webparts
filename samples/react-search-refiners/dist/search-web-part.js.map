Each page's item count is determined by the getItemCountForPage callback if\r\n * provided by the caller, or 10 as default. Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\r\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\r\n *\r\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\r\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\r\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\r\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\r\n *\r\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\r\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\r\n *\r\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\r\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\r\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\r\n *\r\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\r\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\r\n */\r\nexport class List extends BaseComponent<IListProps, IListState> implements IList {\r\n  public static defaultProps = {\r\n    startIndex: 0,\r\n    onRenderCell: (item: any, index: number, containsFocus: boolean) => (<div>{ (item && item.name) || '' }</div>),\r\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\r\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  public refs: {\r\n    [key: string]: React.ReactInstance,\r\n    root: HTMLElement,\r\n    surface: HTMLElement\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\r\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\r\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\r\n    [key: string]: {\r\n      height: number,\r\n      measureVersion: number\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\r\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\r\n  private _scrollingToIndex: number;\r\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\r\n\r\n  // surface rect relative to window\r\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\r\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle | null;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
